# Build a Navbar with Flexbox

This tutorial is heavily based on the "Pure Flexbox navigation code along" module in the [What the Flexbox?!](https://flexbox.io/) course created by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## Step 1: Turn the navbar into a flexbox

[ ] Convert an element (any element!) into a flexbox by changing the `display` property.
[ ] Adjust the grow behavior so links take up the full width of the navbar.

## Step 2: Add links to the navbar

[ ] Add a few list items to the flex container (parent). Instead of text, use an icon. 
[ ] Adjust the grow behavior of the flex items (children) so links with text grow at twice the rate of links with only icons.

## Step 3: Putting a title in the navbar

[ ] Add a title to the `<header>`.
[ ] Convert another element into a flexbox so both the `<header>` and the `<nav>` are inside one flex container.
[ ] Center the content inside the new flex container.
[ ] Adjust the flex item positioning so the `<nav>` is easier to read. 
[ ] Position the `<header>` on the left side of the screen and the `<nav>` on the right.

## Step 4: Centering content in the navbar

[ ] Increase the `font-size` of the links with icons.
[ ] Center the text (vertically and horizontally) of each navbar link.
